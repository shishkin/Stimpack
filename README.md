Stimpack - .NET library for highly reactive applications
===

Stimpack helps writing clear and concise, declarative, domain-specific code by making heavy usage of [the Reactive Extensions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609) library. Stimpack shines the most when it powers asynchronous UIs based on the ViewModel pattern.

The library is aimed to run on the latest versions of Windows Phone, Silverlight and .NET Framework. Support for Mono, Mono for Android and MonoTouch considered strategic.

Stimpack is inspired by [ReactiveUI](http://www.reactiveui.net/), where it borrows most of its core ideas, focusing at the same time on providing a simple and clear API.
